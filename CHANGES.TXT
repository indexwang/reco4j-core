0.3.0 (2013-03-10)

• reco4j-core
  - Improved the quality/performance of FastCollaborativeFilter
  - Cleaned up the IGraph interface removing unused method and adding new more usefull method
  - Addedd support for graph manipulation like addNode, addNodeProperties, addEdge, addEdgeRelationship into IGRaph interface
  - Improved the memory usage, migrating, where possible, from complex object map to long ids (into recommender, similiarity, and so on)
  - Implemented a new recommender MahoutRecommender, a first approach to provide recommendation using mahout as base engine, it will be improved in next release
  - Improved the quality of the MatrixFactorization Recommender, now it perform faster and with the best quality of all the recommenders
  
• reco4j-neo4j
  - Improved more GraphTraversal method to leverage on nodeId instead of node custom identifier to improve the performance
  - Optimized the memory usage of Neo4JNode and Neo4JEdge using weakreference to allow neo4j cache to free up the unused nodes
  - Adapted the Neo4JGraph to the new IGraph interface


0.2.0 (2013-02-01)

• reco4j-core
  - Implemented a new Recommender FastCollaborativeFilter a first approach to reduce the memory footprint and improve the performance it is experimental for now (bug #6)
  - Performance improvement
  - Fixed bug #5
  - Minor bug fix
  
• reco4j-neo4j
  - Implemented a Reco4jRecommender plugin for Neo4j server that allow to access to reco4j functionalities from neo4j rest API
  - Implemented a mechanism for updating a recommender when a new rating is inserted into the graph (bug #8)
  - Implemented a neo4j TransactionEventHandler to intercept new relation between node and recalculating recommender (bug #10)
  - Implemented a new graph traversal engine replacing Gremlin/Groovy with pure java neo4j kernel call (bug #7)
  - Migrated to a new version of neo4j (compilation depends from 1.9m3 but we tested it also on a 1.9m4)
  - Reduced the number of dependencies

• reco4j-neo4j-gremlin
  - New project with the old graph traversal engine and with the class for creating a graph database from Movielens data set
